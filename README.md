# Epidemic-Game
 The project was created for the purpose of completing the course "Game Programming".

## Introduction
The game is a simple platformer with an epidemic theme. It was created by a five-person team, where my task was to program the interface and several mechanics, including player inventory, displaying health status, the ability to collect cards and first aid kits, as well as shooting at enemies.

## Overview
The game starts in the player's room. Dark colors and rain outside the window are meant to convey the depressive nature of the epidemic. In the room, players can also interact with several objects, such as flowers, books, or a poster. Clicking on them will reveal some sad commentary about them. This stage of the game, in particular, resembles a point-and-click game.

When the player chooses VR glasses for the game, they will be transported to another world. At the beginning of his adventure, they will have the opportunity to interact with other NPCs and thus receive gameplay tips from them.

When the player goes to the right, they will come to a portal that will take them to the target platform game.

In this stage, the player's task will be to find yellow and purple cards that unlock the next levels. While traversing the map, he will be able to encounter rotating blades, lasers, small viruses or green acid on his way.

After successfully completing three levels, one more challenge awaits the player. After talking to Sabrina, we should go back to the portal, where Eon will give us more tips on how to continue the game.

After passing through the portal, a new small map will appear on which we must defeat the final source of infection, i.e. the virus

After defeating the enemy, our world will crumble. Then we have to head to the portal on the left side.

After passing through the portal, the game ends. After the virus and the epidemic are gone, our hero begins to see the world in brighter, happier colors.
